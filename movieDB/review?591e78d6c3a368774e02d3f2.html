  <h2><a href="/review/591e78d6c3a368774e02d3f2" title="">Once Upon a Time (2011)</a></h2>
  <h3 class="sub-heading">Written by <a href="/u/Oldnewbie">Oldnewbie</a> on May 19, 2017</h5>
  <p>A superb series finale but...</p>

<p>It is not! Truly this would have been the end the show deserved had this been the final episode.</p>

<p>Apparently it was written as such until the show was renewed BUT with most of the cast moving on contractually already! Yes, a wrap around\ tag on scene\tale opens the show up to an all new reset of the beginning, only with a now adult Henry being approached by his unknown to him daughter (about the same age Henry was when he found Emma in ep 1 season 1)! She says he must go with her cause &quot;his family needs him&quot;. Sound familiar? It would seem Henry, like Emma in that ep, is clueless and so another forgetting spell was cast. Or whatever!</p>

<p>For those who do not know, the next season will no longer have the following characters\actors: Emma Swan, Snow White, Prince Charming, Belle, young Henry, and I am sure I am forgetting one other. The core will be the now adult Henry, Hook, Gold, and the evil queen\not evil anymore.</p>

<p>How the show intends to carry on or explain where everyone missing has gone (yes there was a time jump in the tag on scene of several years) will be interesting to see, but I frankly have little hope for the continued success of the show. It was all about Emma, Snow, Charming, and how everything revolved around them. Without those characters I think it will be a rebooted show trying to be it&#39;s old self but simply unable to.</p>

<p>I mean everyone is together, happy, sitting down to a thanksgiving like meal in this ep&#39;s natural end! Somehow along the way all that is torn apart? Is the ultimate lesson learned to be that there are no happy endings or happy beginnings because even in a fantasy world life sucks? Crap happens to the best of people regardless of what they have overcome to get to a place of stability?</p>

<p>This should have been the end; a fitting finale.</p>
